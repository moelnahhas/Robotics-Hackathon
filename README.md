# Robotics-Hackathon
In the 2025 University of Manchester Robotics Hackathon, I participated in the Toxic Waste Challenge, where our goal was to design and build a robot capable of picking up and transporting canisters to a designated safe zone, all within a 24-hour period. Working as part of a small team, we built and programmed the entire robot from scratch using Arduino.

This experience tested both our technical and problem-solving skills under intense time pressure. Also gave us the creative freedom to invent and 3D print the claws which would be used to grab the canisters. We collaborated closely to create a fully functional robot that could complete the task.

It was a rewarding and fast-paced challenge, and we were proud to have built a robot that performed the tasks successfully by the end of the event.
